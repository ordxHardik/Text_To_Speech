# Text to Speech Recognition Project

This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for a Text to text-to-speech recognition project. The project allows users to input text and instantly receive live speech output. It leverages web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing the Web Speech API to enable text-to-speech functionality.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for converting text into speech. Users can type or paste any text into the input field, and the application will generate speech output in real time. It is a handy tool for various applications, such as accessibility features, language learning, or just for fun.

## Tools Used

- **HTML:** The structure and layout of the project are built using HTML. HTML provides the foundation for creating the user interface elements.

- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used for styling the user interface, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is the core scripting language used to implement the text-to-speech functionality. It interacts with the Web Speech API to convert text into speech and manages user interactions.

- **Web Speech API:** The Web Speech API is a browser API that enables speech synthesis (text-to-speech) and speech recognition (speech-to-text) capabilities. In this project, we use it for speech synthesis to convert text into spoken words.
